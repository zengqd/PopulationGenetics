Stay green (SG) in wheat, a beneficial trait for increasing yield and stress resistance, needs to be supported by analysis of the underlying genetic basis. Spectral indices (SIs) provide non-destructive tools to evaluate crop temporal senescence. However, due to inconsistencies in the growth period, few SI-based SG quantification pipelines for analyzing diverse wheat panels in the field are available. Previous quantitative and genetic analysis of wheat SG was limited to population from two-parent or multi-parent. Here, we first applied SIs to monitor the senescence dynamics of 565 diverse wheat accessions from anthesis to maturation stages during two field seasons. Based on over 12,000 SIs data set, four SIs (NDVI, GNDVI, NDRE and OSAVI) were selected to develop relative stay green scores (RSGS) by normalization and the senescence of wheat populations occurs mainly at four developmental stages, accounting for the final SG indicators. A RSGS-based genome-wide association study identified 47 high-confidence quantitative trait loci (QTL) harboring 3,079 SNPs significantly associated with RSGS and 1,085 corresponding candidate genes in the two seasons; 15 QTL overlapped or were adjacent to known SG-related QTL or genes and the remaining QTL were novel. The utilization of superior candidate genes TraesCS2A03G1081100, TracesCS6B03G0356400, and TracesCS2B03G1299500 haplotypes in China gradually increased following the Green Revolution, thus further validating the feasibility of the pipeline. The study provides a useful reference for further quantitative SG and genetic research in diverse wheat panels.
